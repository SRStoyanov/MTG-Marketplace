# MTG-Marketplace

This is a Single Page Application (SPA) created with the following tech stack:

- ReactJS for the frontend (w/ Vite)
- Firebase & Firestore for the backend

The application is a mock online marketplace for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) cards:

- without authentication, any guest user can see all of the MTG cards available for purchase on the website, and can Login or Register.
- after successful authentication, registered users can upload their own MTG cards and put them up for sale, with all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) available, and they can "buy" cards uploaded by other users.

The application is deployed on Firebase, and interacts with the MTG Gatherer API.

This is a student project created by Sava Stoyanov for the SoftUni ReactJS Oct-Dec 2023 class.
